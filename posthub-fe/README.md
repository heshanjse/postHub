Objec&ve: Build a simple web applica&on where users can post and view messages.
Front-End (React)
1. User Interface: Create a simple and clean UI using React.
o A form for pos&ng messages (a simple text input and a submit buDon).
o A display area for viewing posted messages.
2. State Management: Manage the applica&on's state effec&vely.
o Use local state management for form inputs.
o Op&onally, use Redux or Context API for more complex state management.
3. API Integra&on: Integrate with the Flask backend.
o Use Axios or Fetch API to send requests to the backend.
o Handle responses and errors gracefully.
4. Responsiveness and Styling: Ensure the applica&on is responsive and aesthe&cally
pleasing.
o Use CSS or a styling library like Styled-Components.

Back-End (Flask)
1. API Development: Create a RESTful API.
o Endpoints for pos&ng a message and retrieving all messages.
o Use appropriate HTTP methods and status codes.
2. Data Storage: Implement data persistence.
o Use an in-memory store or a simple database like SQLite.
o Model the data appropriately.
<!-- 3. Concurrency Handling: Leverage Golang's concurrency features.
o Use gorou&nes and channels if necessary for handling mul&ple requests
efficiently. -->

4. Error Handling: Implement proper error handling.
o Return meaningful error messages to the front-end.

Integra<on and Tes<ng
Ensure that the front-end and back-end are properly integrated.
Write unit tests for both front-end and back-end code.
Bonus Challenges
• Implement user authen&ca&on.
• Add the ability for users to edit or delete their messages.
• Deploy the applica&on to a cloud service.
